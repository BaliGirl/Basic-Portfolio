      <p>I was born in a beautiful island of Bali, Indonesia. I have 3 older siblings, 2 older brothers and 1 older sister.  I came to the U.S. as an exchange student in High School and continued my education here in the U.S. to get my B.S. Degree in Computer Science in San Diego State University, San Diego, CA.  
          After graduation, I decided to stay and work in San Diego, CA. </p>
          <p>I met my husband in Salt Lake City, Utah while I was in a business trip and decided to play tennis at local tennis club. I crashed into the Men's 4.0 and up's work out. I decided to move here as my husband's family lives here. 
              We have 3 children, a daughter who is 13 year old, a boy who is 12 year old and a little boy who is 3 year old. </p>
