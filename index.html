          <p>I was born in a beautiful island of Bali, Indonesia. I have 3 older siblings, 2 older brothers and 1 older sister.  My parents and 2 siblings still live in Bali. My oldest brother lives in Los Angeles, CA.
             I came to the U.S. as an exchange student in High School and went to get my B.S. Degree in Computer Science in San Diego State University, San Diego, CA. 
             After graduation, I decided to stay and work in San Diego, CA. 
          </p>
          <p>I met my husband at a local tennis club in Salt Lake City, Utah while I was in a business trip. I crashed in into the Men's 4.5 and up's work out. I decided to move here as my husband's family lives here. 
            We have 3 children, a daughter who is almost 14 year old, 2 boys who are 12 and 3 years old. Our daughter is in competitive soccer and older boy is in competitive Basketball and Football.
          </p>
          <p>When I was living in California, I worked for a few software companies before I decided to move to Utah about 9 years ago. The last company I worked for, it's in Dental software industry.
             Recently, I decided to have a little adventure by doing a small business and yet still in the transition to complete everything. I am pretty excited to use these new skills 
             that I am learning from this web dev bootcamp to design my own company website.
          </p>
          <p>After all, of course like everyone else, I do have some hobbies or interests.  They are:
             <ul>
              <li>Tennis</li>
              <li>Traveling and spending time with my little family</li>
              <li>Crafting</li>
              <li>Surfing</li>
              <li>Cooking &amp; Baking</li>
              <li>Yoga</li>
            </ul>
